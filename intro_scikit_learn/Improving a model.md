We start off with [[baseline predictions]]  and a [[baseline model]] 

Once we've made some baseline predictions and evaluated them, and once we've built a baseline model, we try to improve upon it.

Could we:

From a data perspective:

- collect more data?
- improve our data?
	- more [[features]]
	-  More depth of information within each sample

From a model perspective:

- is there a better model?
	- [sklearn map](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html)
	- Start with a simple model, easier to train
	-  Ensemble classifiers RandomForest more difficult to train
		- Many small models trained at once

- Could we improve the current model
