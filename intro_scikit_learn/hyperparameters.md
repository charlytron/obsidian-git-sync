configurations external to the model and whose values cannot be estimated from data, i.e. settings that we can adjust

once model is instantiated, we can find hyperparameters by calling

`clf.get_params()`

and we'll get all the hyperparameters we can adjust

parameters vs hyperparameters:
 - ML model seeks to find parameters in data on its own
 - hyperparameters are settings on a model that we can adjust
