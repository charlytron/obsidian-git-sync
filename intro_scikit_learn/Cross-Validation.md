splitting our dataset into multiple [[train]] and [[test]]  sets.
Training a model on one particular train and evaluating it on that test set and repeating that for a number of times.

Typically we split X and Y into 5 different [[train]] and [[test]] splits. `scoring=None` is a way of expressing this default.

How many splits to use depends on the size of the dataset and how thorough we want to be with our validation.
